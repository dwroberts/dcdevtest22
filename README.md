# Draw and Code Test App

A small application built on the **MERN Stack** that allows visitors to register a user account, login and update their profile.

## Setting up a local version

The app requires MongoDB to store user data. The details of the MongoD account should be set as an environment variable in a file called .env. There is an example file (.env-example) to get started.

    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=5050
    MONGO_URI=<YOUR_MONGODB_URI>
    JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_SECRET>

# Demo

A demo of the app can be seen **[here](https://dcdevtest22.herokuapp.comg)**.
